                        <p>Sanjay didn't believe in fate — not until 2:03 AM on a Thursday night, when a message pinged on his phone:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"Hey... Is this the page that posted the poem about 'missing someone who's still alive'?"</p>
                        
                        <p>The account was private. No name, just a profile picture of painted skies and a single bio line:</p>
                        
                        <p class="centered">Dreaming in pixels. Healing in silence.</p>
                        
                        <p>He stared at the message. His heart didn't race — it paused.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay had been anonymously running @WhispersInInk, a poetry page with barely 300 followers. He never promoted it. He wrote when his chest got too heavy. He never cared for likes or followers — only for truth, raw and aching, poured into lines.</p>
                        
                        <p>That night, he replied:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sanjay">"Yes. I wrote it."</p>
                        
                        <p>She replied instantly:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"It made me cry. But also… made me feel less alone. Thank you."</p>
                        
                        <p>He stared at her words longer than he should've. It wasn't just a message. It was a whisper across timelines — from one scarred soul to another.</p>
                        
                        <p>He hesitated… then typed:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sanjay">"Thank you for reading."</p>
                        
                        <p>Her name was Sameena.</p>
                        
                        <p>And that was how it began — not with flowers or glances, but with a poem and two tired souls typing quietly into the dark.</p>

                        <p>Sanjay didn't sleep that night. He scrolled through her profile — art, photos of books, videos of rain, quotes about healing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Something about her felt familiar. Like a page from a book he hadn't written yet, but already loved.</p>
                        
                        <p>And somewhere, between 2:03 AM and dawn, he smiled. For the first time in a long time — not because he was happy.</p>
                        
                        <p>But because someone, somewhere, understood the language of his silence.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena's messages became his favorite notifications.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each ping was like a pebble in the still lake of his life. Not disruptive, but gently reminding him he wasn't alone.</p>
                        
                        <p>She asked thoughtful questions: "What does your silence sound like?"</p>
                        
                        <p>He answered honestly: "Like an old song nobody listens to, but I still remember every word."</p>
                        
                        <p>She sent voice notes. Her voice was calm, raw, imperfect. She didn't try to sound beautiful. She already was.</p>
                        
                        <p>One night, she sent him a note at 1:11 AM:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"Sanjay, you write the kind of pain people avoid. But I want to read it all."</p>
                        
                        <p>He stared at that message for ten minutes, replaying it. Not for validation.</p>
                        
                        <p>But because it felt like someone finally saw the storm he'd been hiding.</p>

                        <p>They started playing a little game. Each night, one would send a question. The other had to answer honestly.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena asked: "What memory do you wish you could live again?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay replied: "The night my dad held my hand during a thunderstorm. He said, 'The sky only shouts when it's afraid too.'"</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay asked: "What's one thing you never say out loud?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena replied: "I'm scared people only like the version of me that smiles."</p>
                        
                        <p>In every answer, they unfolded. Layer by layer. Until vulnerability didn't feel like weakness.</p>
                        
                        <p>It felt like trust.</p>
                        
                        <p>They planned a meet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Just coffee. No expectations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay wore the only shirt he ironed himself — navy blue, slightly wrinkled, but honest.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena walked in wearing oversized denim and silver jhumkas. Hair tied. No makeup.</p>
                        
                        <p>When their eyes met, both forgot what nerves felt like.</p>
                        
                        <p>They didn't shake hands. They didn't hug.</p>
                        
                        <p>They just sat down. As if they'd done this a thousand times in dreams.</p>

                        <p>Sameena laughed with her whole face. Sanjay noticed. He also noticed she blinked faster when nervous.</p>
                        
                        <p>She said, "I don't believe in soulmates."</p>

                        <p>They started seeing each other more often.</p>
                        
                        <p>Evening walks. Silent rooftops. A bookstore where they sat and read without buying anything.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay took photos of Sameena when she wasn't looking.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena sketched Sanjay's silhouette into her diary, captioning it:</p>

                        <p>Not just outside, but inside Sameena.</p>
                        
                        <p>She texted him: "Come. I don't want to talk. Just… be here."</p>
                        
                        <p>He showed up. No questions.</p>
                        
                        <p>She was curled on the floor. Hair messy. Eyes red.</p>
                        
                        <p>He sat beside her. No words.</p>
                        
                        <p>And in that silence, she whispered, "You make even my worst days breathable."</p>
                        
                        <p>He held her hand.</p>
                        
                        <p>And in that moment, love didn't need a confession.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena gave him a small handmade gift — a box filled with 27 folded paper stars.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each star had a line from one of his poems.</p>
                        
                        <p>"I read them when I forget how to feel," she said.</p>
                        
                        <p>He opened one:</p>
                        
                        <p class="centered">"You can't lose someone who became part of your breathing."</p>
                        
                        <p>He didn't cry.</p>
                        
                        <p>But he did look at her the way people look at miracles — gently, with disbelief.</p>

                        <p>They just touched foreheads.</p>
                        
                        <p>Two storms, finally resting.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their love wasn't loud.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was in the way Sanjay sent her playlists for different moods.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was in the way Sameena made space on her desk just for his notes.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was in the good mornings and voice notes and memes at 2 AM.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was love — not in grand gestures.</p>
                        
                        <p>But in soft, everyday repetitions.</p>

                        <p>Some days, she went silent.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some days, he overthought every word.</p>
                        
                        <p>One night she messaged:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"What if I'm too much? Too broken?"</p>

                        <p class="sanjay">"Then I'll be the glue. Or the arms. Or the poem that tells you you're enough."</p>
                        
                        <p>She didn't reply that night.</p>
                        
                        <p>But the next morning, she sent a picture of the sunrise.</p>
                        
                        <p>Captioned: "You remind me of this. Constant, even after dark."</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay once asked, "What does peace look like to you?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena replied, "A room where I don't have to shrink to fit in."</p>
                        
                        <p>He said, "Then let's build it. Even if it's just with words and Sunday mornings."</p>
                        
                        <p>She smiled. Because no one ever offered her space before — only silence.</p>

                        <p>They had a playlist. Not of love songs. But of songs that healed.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Ek Tarfa" when they missed each other.</p>

                        <p>Each song — a timestamp of emotions too fragile to say aloud.</p>
                        
                        <p>One day, she sent him a drawing of a boy holding a balloon shaped like a heart.</p>
                        
                        <p>The caption read:</p>
                        
                        <p class="centered">"He gives pieces of himself, hoping someone calls it love."</p>

                        <p>Then replied: "He just needs someone to hold the balloon with him. I will."</p>
                        
                        <p>She was afraid of attachments. He was afraid of being forgotten.</p>
                        
                        <p>Together, they wrote letters they never sent. Journals filled with 'almosts' and 'what-ifs.'</p>
                        
                        <p>But somehow, it was still real.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because feelings don't wait for perfect timing.</p>
                        
                        <p>They just bloom — wildly, unexpectedly.</p>

                        <p>Sameena said, "I'll never forget the poet."</p>

                        <p>Sanjay added tiny poems between them:</p>

                        <p>They made a universe of hope inside a rented room.</p>
                        
                        <p>Arguments happened.</p>
                        
                        <p>Once, Sameena cried because he didn't reply for six hours.</p>
                        
                        <p>He said, "I was drowning."</p>
                        
                        <p>She said, "You could've reached for me."</p>
                        
                        <p>They sat in silence, both realizing — love isn't just about feeling.</p>
                        
                        <p>It's about responsibility.</p>

                        <p>Two lives, gently braided.</p>
                        
                        <p>One night, he texted:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sanjay">"What are we?"</p>
                        
                        <p>She replied:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"Two people who found peace in each other's noise."</p>
                        
                        <p>And that night, peace had a name.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was whispered like a prayer — Sameena.</p>

                        <p>Waves crashing. Hearts listening.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena said, "If I die first, will you write me?"</p>
                        
                        <p>He smiled sadly. "I already am."</p>

                        <p>One morning, Sanjay made her breakfast.</p>
                        
                        <p>Burnt toast. Overboiled chai. Lopsided smile.</p>

                        <p>They visited a temple. She prayed. He watched.</p>
                        
                        <p>Afterwards, she asked, "Don't you believe?"</p>

                        <p>She held his hand tighter.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because faith comes in many forms. And sometimes, it's shaped like a person.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena got sick.</p>
                        
                        <p>Not dangerously. But enough to scare him.</p>
                        
                        <p>He sat by her bed, writing poems on post-its.</p>
                        
                        <p>Placing one on her pillow: "Even your cough sounds like a verse I want to memorize."</p>

                        <p>Because it kept raining.</p>
                        
                        <p>So instead, they watched raindrops race on glass.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena whispered, "Maybe these are our stars."</p>
                        
                        <p>One day, they sat in a crowded café.</p>
                        
                        <p>Everyone noisy. Everything loud.</p>
                        
                        <p>But in the corner, with hands locked and glances exchanged — they were their own quiet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay wrote a poem he never posted:</p>
                        
                        <p class="centered">"You're not my world. You're the silence that holds it together."</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena found it in his notebook.</p>
                        
                        <p>She didn't say a word.</p>
                        
                        <p>She just kissed the page.</p>

                        <p>Sameena once said, "If this ends… don't erase me."</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay replied, "Even if it ends — you'll always be the underline of every line I write."</p>
                        
                        <p>And in that moment, they didn't talk about endings.</p>
                        
                        <p>They just held on tighter.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because sometimes, holding on is the most romantic thing two people can do.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena painted a canvas for him.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was abstract — waves, stars, and a small figure holding a lantern.</p>
                        
                        <p>When Sanjay asked what it meant, she smiled.</p>
                        
                        <p>"You're the lantern. You don't fix the night, but you make it bearable."</p>
                        
                        <p>He stared at it for hours that night.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay wasn't a fan of pictures.</p>
                        
                        <p>But she caught him off guard one evening, snapped a photo while he was laughing mid-sentence.</p>
                        
                        <p>She showed it to him and whispered,</p>
                        
                        <p>"This is what my peace looks like."</p>
                        
                        <p>That became his favorite picture.</p>

                        <p>Sameena had a habit of making playlists.</p>
                        
                        <p>One day she sent one titled: For The Boy With Tired Eyes.</p>
                        
                        <p>He listened to every song. Twice.</p>
                        
                        <p>On repeat.</p>

                        <p>tapping rhythm into his hollow spaces.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their first real fight wasn't about something big.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was distance.</p>
                        
                        <p>A missed call. A cold reply.</p>
                        
                        <p>Two tired people not knowing how to say:</p>
                        
                        <p>"I miss you."</p>
                        
                        <p>It ended with her sending a one-line message:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"Can we not lose each other too?"</p>
                        
                        <p>They didn't.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay once broke down on a video call.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena didn't interrupt.</p>
                        
                        <p>She just kept the call going,</p>
                        
                        <p>showing him the night sky,</p>
                        
                        <p>humming softly.</p>

                        <p>"You're allowed to take space here. It's yours too."</p>
                        
                        <p>They planned a trip.</p>
                        
                        <p>Just a weekend getaway — trains, cheap hotels, stolen moments.</p>
                        
                        <p>It wasn't about luxury.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was about being themselves — fully, loudly, without screens or goodbyes.</p>

                        <p>That trip changed everything.</p>
                        
                        <p>They kissed under a thunderstorm.</p>
                        
                        <p>Shared fries at a roadside stall.</p>
                        
                        <p>Watched movies curled up under one blanket.</p>

                        <p>It was subtle.</p>
                        
                        <p>But powerful.</p>
                        
                        <p>A small word that carried years of longing</p>
                        
                        <p>and the quiet hope:</p>
                        
                        <p>maybe this time, love wouldn't disappear.</p>
                        
                        <p>One night, they lay on the floor, earphones split,</p>
                        
                        <p>listening to a lo-fi track.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena whispered,</p>
                        
                        <p>"I don't think I'm built for forever."</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay kissed her knuckles and said:</p>
                        
                        <p>"Then let me be your always, one day at a time."</p>

                        <p>After things settled, she left him a voice note:</p>

                        <p>He kept that audio.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sometimes, when the world got too loud,</p>
                        
                        <p>he played it on loop</p>
                        
                        <p>until it felt like her voice could stitch him back together.</p>
                        
                        <p>They never labeled their relationship.</p>
                        
                        <p>Not yet.</p>
                        
                        <p>But one night, she asked,</p>

                        <p>Sanjay replied,</p>
                        
                        <p>"Poetry. Because even your silence has rhythm."</p>
                        
                        <p>And she didn't reply — she just kissed him.</p>

                        <p>And that said everything.</p>
                        
                        <p>There was a phase where they stopped texting as often.</p>
                        
                        <p>Life got loud.</p>
                        
                        <p>But on the days he doubted it all,</p>
                        
                        <p>he'd open their old chat,</p>
                        
                        <p>scroll to the first time she said,</p>
                        
                        <p>"Thank you for existing."</p>
                        
                        <p>It reminded him — some people arrive like seasons. And stay.</p>
                        
                        <p>She once wrote a note in his notebook.</p>
                        
                        <p>He found it weeks later.</p>
                        
                        <p>It read:</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"If ever you feel unloved, read this."</p>
                        
                        <p>And beneath that,</p>
                        
                        <p class="sameena">"I love you more than the sun loves the sky — because even the sky gets cloudy sometimes."</p>

                        <p>Sanjay surprised her with a stargazing night.</p>
                        
                        <p>They drove out of the city,</p>
                        
                        <p>sat on the hood, watching constellations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena rested her head on his shoulder and said,</p>
                        
                        <p>"You're not just a person, Sanjay. You're a whole galaxy that never scared me."</p>
                        
                        <p>They didn't always agree.</p>
                        
                        <p>But even in fights,</p>
                        
                        <p>he never raised his voice.</p>
                        
                        <p>And she never walked away.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their rule:</p>
                        
                        <p>"We're on the same side — even when it's storming."</p>
                        
                        <p>And that kept them whole.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay bought her a tiny ring.</p>
                        
                        <p>Nothing fancy.</p>
                        
                        <p>But inside it was engraved:</p>
                        
                        <p class="centered">"Still. Always."</p>
                        
                        <p>When he gave it to her, he said,</p>
                        
                        <p>"You don't have to wear it on your finger. Just keep it where your heart remembers."</p>

                        <p>Close to her chest.</p>
                        
                        <p>She said, "It's my armor."</p>

                        <p>someone once saw every scar, and still chose to stay.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena wanted to run away some days.</p>
                        
                        <p>From pressure, pain, people.</p>
                        
                        <p>But Sanjay never told her to "stay strong."</p>
                        
                        <p>He simply said,</p>
                        
                        <p>"If you run, I'll walk beside you. If you fall, I'll lie down next to you."</p>
                        
                        <p>She had her own dreams.</p>
                        
                        <p>Not just love — her art, her identity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay never stood in front of them.</p>
                        
                        <p>He stood beside them.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because loving her didn't mean owning her.</p>

                        <p>He kissed her forehead and said,</p>

                        <p>But at night, he called and said,</p>

                        <p>And she whispered,</p>

                        <p>"Then I'll fall back in. Again and again. Until love is tired of running from us."</p>
                        
                        <p>They stood at a wedding. Not theirs.</p>
                        
                        <p>But watching vows being exchanged,</p>
                        
                        <p>Sameena squeezed his hand and smiled.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanjay mouthed,</p>
                        
                        <p>"We'll get there. But we're already forever, aren't we?"</p>
                        
                        <p>One night, he was quiet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Tired. Heavy.</p>
                        
                        <p>She didn't ask what was wrong.</p>
                        
                        <p>She just laid her head on his lap and whispered,</p>
                        
                        <p>"If you can't be strong today, let me be enough for both of us."</p>

                        <p>They're sitting on a balcony.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sun setting. Quiet music.</p>
                        
                        <p>She looks at him and asks,</p>

                        <p>"Even in every lifetime where we never meet — I'd still look for you."</p>
